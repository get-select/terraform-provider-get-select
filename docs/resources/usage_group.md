# select_usage_group (Resource)



## About 

Usage Groups provide a flexible way of creating cost categories within SELECT. To learn more about usage groups, see the [SELECT documentation](https://select.dev/docs/reference/using-select/usage-groups).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage Group

```terraform
resource "select_usage_group" "analytics" {
  name               = "Analytics Team"
  order              = 1
  budget             = 5000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "and"
    filters = [
      {
        field    = "role_name"
        operator = "in"
        values   = ["ANALYST", "DATA_SCIENTIST"]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### Advanced Filter Expression Examples

#### Filter by Role and Warehouse
```hcl
resource "select_usage_group" "analytics_team" {
  name               = "Analytics Team"
  order              = 1
  budget             = 5000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "and"
    filters = [
      {
        field    = "role_name"
        operator = "in"
        values   = ["ANALYST", "DATA_SCIENTIST"]
      },
      {
        field    = "warehouse_name" 
        operator = "in"
        values   = ["ANALYTICS_WH", "ML_WH"]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### Filter by User or Database Tag
```hcl
resource "select_usage_group" "finance_users" {
  name               = "Finance Department"
  order              = 2
  budget             = 3000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "or"
    filters = [
      {
        field = "user_name"
        operator = "in"
        values = [
          "USER_NAME"
        ]
      },
      {
        field = "database_tags"
        operator = "array_contains"
        values = [
          "ORG_TEAM: finance"
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the usage group
- `order` (Number) The display order and cost allocation precedence of the usage group within its usage group set. Must be a non-negative integer. When usage groups have overlapping filter expressions, cost allocation goes to the usage group with the lowest order value first. We strongly recommend using unique order values per usage group within a set.
- `usage_group_set_id` (String) The ID of the usage group set

### Optional

- `budget` (Number) The budget allocated to this usage group
- `filter_expression_json` (String) A JSON string representing the filter expression that defines which usage belongs to this group
- `organization_id` (String)

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the usage group was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the usage group.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp when the usage group was last updated.
- `usage_group_set_name` (String) The name of the usage group set this usage group belongs to.

### Filter Expressions

The `filter_expression_json` field accepts a JSON encoded object that will be validated when applied. There's a wide variety of fields that can be filtered on depending on the type of usage group (such as Snowflake account or organization owned). 

To explore the fields that can be filtered on, or for complicated filter expressions containing multiple statements, we suggest using the SELECT UI to configure something close to the structure you need, and then switching to JSON mode and copying the expression into your terraform code, reformatting into a valid terraform block.

## Import

`select_usage_group` can be imported using the usage group set ID and usage group ID separated by a forward slash:

```bash
terraform import select_usage_group.example <usage_group_set_id>/<usage_group_id>
```

The ID of an existing usage group can be obtained by switching to JSON mode in the SELECT UI and copying the ID from the JSON document. See the `select_usage_group_set` resource documentation to see how to obtain the usage group set id.
