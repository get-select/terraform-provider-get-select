# select_usage_group (Resource)



## About 

Usage Groups provide a flexible way to create cost categories within SELECT. Learn more in the [SELECT documentation](https://select.dev/docs/reference/using-select/usage-groups).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage Group

```terraform
resource "select_usage_group" "analytics" {
  name               = "Analytics Team"
  order              = 1
  budget             = 5000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "and"
    filters = [
      {
        field    = "role_name"
        operator = "in"
        values   = ["ANALYST", "DATA_SCIENTIST"]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### Advanced Filter Examples

#### Filter by Role and Warehouse
```hcl
resource "select_usage_group" "analytics_team" {
  name               = "Analytics Team"
  order              = 1
  budget             = 5000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "and"
    filters = [
      {
        field    = "role_name"
        operator = "in"
        values   = ["ANALYST", "DATA_SCIENTIST"]
      },
      {
        field    = "warehouse_name" 
        operator = "in"
        values   = ["ANALYTICS_WH", "ML_WH"]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### Filter by User or Warehouse
```hcl
resource "select_usage_group" "finance_users" {
  name               = "Finance Department"
  order              = 2
  budget             = 3000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "or"
    filters = [
      {
        field = "user_name"
        operator = "in"
        values = ["USER_NAME"]
      },
      {
        field = "warehouse_name"
        operator = "in"
        values = ["WAREHOUSE_NAME_LARGE", "WAREHOUSE_NAME_SMALL"]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### Usage Group Based on Snowflake Tags

Create usage groups based on Snowflake tags for better organization.

```hcl
resource "snowflake_tag" "analytics_tag" {
  name     = "Analytics Team Tag"
  database = "database"
  schema   = "schema"
}

resource "snowflake_tag_association" "user_tag_assignment" {
  object_identifier {
    name = "ANALYST_USER"
  }
  object_type = "USER"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.analytics_tag.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "analytics"
}

resource "select_usage_group" "analytics_users" {
  name               = snowflake_tag.analytics_tag.name
  order              = 1
  budget             = 5000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "or"
    filters = [
      {
        field    = "user_tags"
        values   =  [`${snowflake_tag.analytics_tag.name}: ${snowflake_tag_association.user_tag_assignment.tag_value}`]
        operator = "array_contains"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### Creating Multiple Usage Groups

Use `for_each` to dynamically create usage groups for teams:

```hcl
locals {
  teams = {
    analytics = {
      name   = "Analytics Team"
      budget = 5000.0
      users  = ["analyst_1", "data_scientist_1"]
    }
    finance = {
      name   = "Finance Team"
      budget = 3000.0
      users  = ["finance_manager", "accountant_1"]
    }
  }
}

resource "select_usage_group" "team_groups" {
  for_each = local.teams
  
  name               = each.value.name
  order              = index(keys(local.teams), each.key) + 1
  budget             = each.value.budget
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.production.id
  
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    operator = "or"
    filters = [
      {
        field    = "user_name"
        operator = "in"
        values   = each.value.users
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the usage group
- `order` (Number) The display order and cost allocation precedence of the usage group within its usage group set. Must be a non-negative integer. When usage groups have overlapping filter expressions, cost allocation goes to the usage group with the lowest order value first. We strongly recommend using unique order values per usage group within a set.
- `usage_group_set_id` (String) The ID of the usage group set

### Optional

- `budget` (Number) The budget allocated to this usage group
- `filter_expression_json` (String) A JSON string representing the filter expression that defines which usage belongs to this group
- `organization_id` (String)

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the usage group was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the usage group.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp when the usage group was last updated.
- `usage_group_set_name` (String) The name of the usage group set this usage group belongs to.

### Filter Expressions

The `filter_expression_json` field accepts a JSON-encoded object with filter criteria. Available fields vary by usage group type.

**Tip**: Use the SELECT UI to configure complex filters, then switch to JSON mode and copy the expression into your Terraform configuration.

#### Tag Filtering

Different Snowflake tag types require specific filter fields in SELECT:
- `user_tags` - for tags associated with users
- `database_tags` - for tags associated with databases  
- `warehouse_tags` - for tags associated with warehouses
- `role_tags` - for tags associated with roles

The value to filter user_tags is of the format
`TAG_NAME: TAG_VALUE`

**Coming Soon**: An `object_tags` field will be added to filter across all tag associations simultaneously.

## Import

`select_usage_group` can be imported using the usage group set ID and usage group ID separated by a forward slash:

```bash
terraform import select_usage_group.example <usage_group_set_id>/<usage_group_id>
```

To find the usage group ID, switch to JSON mode in the SELECT UI and copy the ID from the JSON document. See the `select_usage_group_set` resource documentation for obtaining the usage group set ID.
