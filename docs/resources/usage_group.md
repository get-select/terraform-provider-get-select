# select_usage_group (Resource)


Usage groups provide a flexible way to create cost categories within select. Check out the official [docs](https://select.dev/docs/reference/using-select/usage-groups) to learn more 


<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the usage group
- `order` (Number) The display order and cost allocation precedence of the usage group within its usage group set. Must be a non-negative integer. When usage groups have overlapping filter expressions, cost allocation goes to the usage group with the lowest order value first. We strongly recommend using unique order values per usage group within a set.
- `usage_group_set_id` (String) The ID of the usage group set

### Optional

- `budget` (Number) The budget allocated to this usage group
- `filter_expression_json` (String) A JSON string representing the filter expression that defines which usage belongs to this group
- `organization_id` (String) The organization ID that owns this usage group

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the usage group was created
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the usage group
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp when the usage group was last updated
- `usage_group_set_name` (String) The name of the usage group set this usage group belongs to

## Import
This resource supports the terraform import command, which can be helpful for migrating to managing usage group sets in terraform.

For a resource definition like
```tf
resource "select_usage_group" "example_usage_group" {
  name               = "example-name"
  order              = 1
  budget             = 1000.0
  usage_group_set_id = select_usage_group_set.example_usage_group_set.id
  filter_expression_json = jsonencode({
    "operator" : "or",
    "filters" : [
      {
        "field" : "warehouse_name",
        "values" : ["SELECT_BACKEND", "SELECT_BACKEND_LARGE"],
        "operator" : "in",
      }
    ],
  })
}

```
This resource could be imported like
`terraform import select_usage_group.example_usage_group <usage group set id>/<usage group id>`

This uses a hierarchical id where `<usage group set id>` is the id of the usage group set this resource belongs to, and `<usage group id>` can be found on the usage groups page of the SELECT app by switching from interactive mode to 

Next, run `terraform plan` and update the `example_usage_group_set` resource block until no changes to the imported resource are planned.
