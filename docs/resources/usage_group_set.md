## Import
This resource supports the terraform import command, which can be helpful for migrating to managing usage group sets in terraform.

For a resource definition like
```tf
resource "select_usage_group_set" "example_usage_group_set" {
  name                   = "example-name"
  order                  = 1
  snowflake_account_uuid = "snowflake-account-uuid"
}
```
This resource could be imported like
`terraform import select_usage_group_set.example_usage_group_set <usage group set id>`

`<usage group set id>` can be found in the usage group page of the SELECT APP. Select teh usage group you would like to import and note it's UUID in the URL parameters, for example `usageGroupSetId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

Next, run `terraform plan` and update the `example_usage_group_set` resource block until no changes to the imported resource are planned.
