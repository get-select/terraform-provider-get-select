## About

This script generates Terraform resources that match your existing usage groups in SELECT. 

**Use cases:**
- **Migration**: Convert existing usage groups to Terraform management
- **Initial setup**: Configure usage groups in the SELECT UI, then export them to Terraform

For a step-by-step guide, see the [migration documentation](https://select.dev/docs/reference/usage-guide/migrating-usage-groups-to-terraform).
